                    <p>Milstein modules require a minimal amount of ecobricks to start.   All you need is a dozen or so ecobricks of the exact same size to get started.  You can use silicone or old inner-tubes to combine them.  Modules are a short-term circular application that with proper care will last years before needing repair.</p>

                    <p>The GEA approved methods here do not damage the ecobricks during their life cycle.  This means that modules can easily be repaired or they can be disassembled and the ecobricks put to use in a new application.</p>

                    <p>Milstein Modules can be used individually as convenient seats that are sliding and stackable.  Hexagon milstein modules can be  like honeycomb to create horizontal surfaces like tables, beds, benches and more.  Triangle modules can be interlocked with hexagons to make a second level.  For full vertical building see Dieleman module.</p>

                    <p>Ecobrick modular applications are indefinitely scalable.  The more you have the more you can build.  Eventually with hundreds of milstein and dielman communities create Ecobrick Open Spaces— interactive community spaces that can be built, un-built, and built again during conferences and gatherings to serve the needs of the moment.</p>

                    <p>It is important to use modules indoors. Ecobricks should never be exposed to the sun. Ultra violet (UV) rays will gradually fade the ecobricks colors and photo-degrade the plastic bottle’s PET.  After only two or three years, the brittle bottle risks crack and burst, releasing all our hard packed plastic.  Keeping modules entirely indoors and out of the sun is essential to preventing degradation.</p>

                    <p>Hexagon milstein modules are made with 19 Ecobricks, these modules make the best stools and are the most versatile.  Hexagon modules can combine them like honey-comb.  Use them to build tables, stages, walls and more.</p>

                    <p>Hexagon and triangle modules can be stacked ontop of each other in a way that interlocks.  This is a nifty and practical way to build a second level to make chairs and tables.</p>

                    <p>Dieleman modules are another type of ecobrick module.  They are made with 16 ecobricks and enable vertical and horizontal building.  We have a special on Dieleman Modules.</p>

                    <h4>Silicone Method</h4>
                    <h5>The original and most enduring making milstein modules is using silicone sealant.</h5>   
                    <br>
                    </div>

                    <button onclick="preclosed3()" class="block-toggle" id="block-toggle-show3">+</button>
                </div>

                <div id="preclosed3">
                
                <br>

                <p>Normal, everyday silicone sealant can be used to make mistein modules.  This is the orginal way to make modules, by using silicone sealant.  Builder’s silicone, also known as “caulking” and “aquarium sealant” is inexpensively found in hardware stores around the world.  Silicone is non-petroleum.  It is not a type of plastic, and it does not degrades into microplastics, nor leach toxins or interfere with ecological cycles.  The HDPE plastic bottle can be easily recycled and/or used in your projects.  See the chart at the bottom of the page on how this method compares with others.</p>
                <h4>Preparation</h4>
                <p>To start you will need a well ventilated space, a perfectly flat surface, a caulking gun, a tube of silicone, a knife and of course, your ecobricks.  Hopefully, you’ve followed <a href="/how">GEA ecobrick making and storage directions</a>, so that you can easily pick a selection of colored ecobricks to make a cool pattern.</p>
                
                <p>There are many different types of silicone – our experience is that the cheapest all-purpose product (<strong>not </strong>special-brand or special purpose version) at your local hard ware store works best. Avoid colored silicones and stick to clear.</p>
                
                <h4>Safety</h4>
                
                <p>Make sure you’re working outside or with a fan, because as silicone cures it releases vinegar gas (acetic acid).&nbsp; It’s not good for you or your helpers if you breathe too much of this.&nbsp; Ideally, have a partner assist:&nbsp; one person holds and places the ecobricks, the other operates the silicone gun.</p>

                <h4>To Start…</h4>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Go through your available ecobricks and create a beautiful pattern using the bottom colors of the ecobricks.&nbsp; Arrange you ecobricks in the desired module pattern with the bottom down.</li>
                    <li>When you’re pattern is set, remove the cap of the center ecobrick (this will help guide you as the module grows).</li>
                    <li>Insert the silicone tube into your caulking gun and use your knife to cut the top off your silicone tube and the nozzle.&nbsp; Be sure to ecobrick the plastic cuttings!</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Siliconing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>One partner removes the center ecobrick from the test arrangement and holds it for the other to silicone.</li>
                    <li>Lay a single thick a bead of silicone down the side of the ecobrick.&nbsp; The bead should be high, not squished or flat – this will help create the strongest bonds between bottles.</li>
                    <li>Place the bottle down in the center of the flat space you’ve chosen.&nbsp; Take the next ecobrick, and press it gently against your center bottle.&nbsp; And your off!</li>
                    <li>Grab the third bottle.&nbsp; This time add two beads of silicone down the sides of the bottle (where the bottles will touch the two other).&nbsp; Gently press this bottle against the first two.</li>
                    <li>Ideally your high silicone beads compress nicely, maximizing the contact surface.</li>
                    <li>Continue adding ecobricks in this way, from the center outwards.</li>
                    <li>Be sure as you press new bottles into the pattern that you do not disturb the bonds of the earlier bottles.&nbsp; Try to avoid repressing bottles together after they’ve been set.&nbsp; Undisturbed silicone joints are strongest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be careful as you work to not lean over the pattern</strong>— the vinegar fumes from the silicone are strongest here.&nbsp; Always work from around the outside.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Finishing up</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once all your bottles are all laid, its time to… <strong>wait</strong>!</li>
                    <li>Do not move or even touch your module for the next two hours.&nbsp; After two hours, you can safely put the cap back on the center bottle and if necessarily gently slide the modules (but its best not to!).</li>
                    <li>After 24 hours you can move the module.</li>
                    <li>After 36 hours (i.e. when you can no longer small the silicone drying smell) your module is good to sit and even stand on!</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>With luck, you have a mechanics shop near you that works with motor bikes.&nbsp; By using the old inner tubes from motor cycles we can also connect our ecobricks together.&nbsp; Unfortunately, bicycle and car tires are too small and too big for the straightforward application of this method.&nbsp; But you’re welcome to try – it all depends on the diameter of your ecobricks and that of the inner-tube.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike old methods of tying a stack of ecobricks together with a long vertical strip of innertube, in the tire banding technique, we cut the tubes <strong>horizontally</strong> to make many small elastic bands.&nbsp; Just like the siliconing method, we’re not permanently bonding the ecobricks together, so that later the module can be fixed or destroyed without damaging the ecobricks.</p>
                    
                    <p>Like all ecobrick applications, the making process works best collaboratively.&nbsp; You’ll need a partner, some ecobricks and a wooded stick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ecobrick packing stick or an <a href="/earthwand">earthwand</a> will do the trick!</p>
                    
                    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                    
                    <p><a href="https://cdn.ecobricks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tire-band-diagram.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-39529 " src="https://cdn.ecobricks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tire-band-diagram-300x211.png" alt="" width="345" height="243"></a>We’ve found that motor cycle tires are ideal for binding 600ml bottles.&nbsp; Use only identical bottled ecobricks for one module.&nbsp; Really old inner tubes, or those that have been exposed to the sun won’t work – they will snap too easily.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take your scissors and cut across the inner tube to make a ring.&nbsp; As you cut the tube into bands, angle your cuts slightly so that the bottom of the band is slightly smaller than the top – about 1 centimenter on the bottom and 1.3 cm on the top.&nbsp; This will help you maximize the number of bands you can get out of the tube, while minimizing waste.</li>
                        
                        <li>Cut only about six bands to start as you will need to test the dimensions/elastacity of your bands before you cut the rest of the tire.</li>
                        
                        <li>Hopefully you’ve follow the recommended ecobrick <a href="/how">making and storage methods</a> so that you’re ecobricks have colored bottoms and are easily accessible.&nbsp; Arrange your ecobricks to make a pattern of colored bottoms (this will be the top of your module).</li>
                        
                        <li>Slide a band over the bottom and the top of your center ecobrick.&nbsp; Bring out the adjacent ecobrick.&nbsp; Slide the top and bottom elastics over the second ecobrick so that it is partnered with the first.</li>
                        
                        <li>Now connect your second ecobrick, in the same way to a third.&nbsp; In this way you’ll have three partners attached in a line.</li>
                        
                        <li>Push all three bottles together and connect bottle the first bottle, to the third.&nbsp; The ecobricks should be tightly bonded in a triad!&nbsp; They should not be able to slide back and forth or wiggle.&nbsp; If your bonds are too loose (or too tight!), go back to cutting your elastics.&nbsp; By adjust the thickness of your elastic you can adjust the tightness of your tube bonds.</li>
                        
                        <li>Once you’ve got a good feel for the sizing of your bands, cut the entire up into bands.&nbsp; You’ll eventually be able to put them all to use.&nbsp; See if you can do it without creating any waste snippets!&nbsp; Of course… every bit of excess cutting, you can put into an ecobrick (like the nozzle)!&nbsp; <strong>This makes this a zero-waste making method.</strong></li>
                        
                        <li>Alright… that was the easy part!&nbsp; Now, connect ecobrick No. 4 to ecobrick No.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect No. 4 to No.2…. Continue to add on ecobricks in this way.&nbsp; It won’t be easy, as the bonds will start to get tight and overlap.&nbsp; This is where working with a partner comes in handy.</li>
                        
                        <li>Have one partner hold the connected ecobricks and another adding the new ecobrick.&nbsp; Use a stick or <a href="/earthwand">earthwand</a> to press down the elastics&nbsp; as you go.</li>
                        
                        <li>Continue adding ecobricks until you’ve completed your triangle or hexagon module.</li>
                        
                        <li>Use your stick to level out the elastics on the side so that they make a neat, level line around the outside.</li>

                        <h5>Plastic is potentially a toxic material.  When working and building with plastic it is essential to plan ahead for the next thousand years.  Ecobricking and Earth Building are a way to secure plastic and put it onto a secure long-term trajectory.</h5>

                    <p>The danger of plastic comes from its exposed surface area.  To the extent that plastic’s surface area is exposed to the elements, it will steadily break down over time into smaller and smaller pieces (microplastics) and leach toxins.  By packing and covering ecobricks we keep the plastic safe and secure.</p>

                    <p>Packing plastic into an ecobrick results in the terminal reduction of net surface area. An ecobrick is essentially many many square meters of plastic compressed into a very small space!  Using earth to build with ecobricks is a way to further secure plastic.</p>

                    <p>Earth building involves making a mortar (known as ‘cob’, 'adobe', 'daub', ect.) to completely encase ecobricks. This way not a single square-centimeter of plastic is exposed! Without exposure to sun, friction, or heat the plastic inside the ecobricks can no longer degrade in any way.</p>

                    <p>It is also important to consider the abandonment of projects. Cob, in contrast to cement, can be more readily populated by plants. Even if long-term structures collapse, earth covered ecobricks have no way to degrade and will remain intact indefinitely. The crumbled earth gradually becomes fertile ground for plants, trees, and forest to cover.</p>

                    <p> By building with earth, using circular and spiral principles, we point our ecobricks towards a secured long-term journey through time.</p>

                    <p>We call this trajectory ‘plastic sequestration‘.</p>

                    <p> Earth and Ecobrick constructions embody large amounts of secured plastic.  When building on government or community land, it is key to establish a long term custodial agreement with the owners of the property.  This agreement must include yearly checkups and repairs and also a plan for the destruction of the construction to ensure the indefinite integrity of the ecobricks. This agreement must also account for the eventual removal, ownership and reuse of the embodied ecobricks.</p>

                    <p>It is important not to forget our responsibility when building with plastic.  Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic, and if our constructions lack planning and maintenance, there is the risk of the plastic escaping loose into the biosphere.  Planning for the maintenance and the end of the construction is a key part of plastic sequestration!</p>
                   
                    <p>The Earth Building technique can completely cover ecobricks, effectively securing them indefinitely in the construction.  This keeps them safe from UV light and other forms of degradation.  After 10, 20 or 100 years, when your structure comes to its end (as everything eventually does) the ecobricks can be extricated undamaged and fully repurposed.</p>
