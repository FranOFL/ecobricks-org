                    <p>Milstein modules require a minimal amount of ecobricks to start.   All you need is a dozen or so ecobricks of the exact same size to get started.  You can use silicone or old inner-tubes to combine them.  Modules are a short-term circular application that with proper care will last years before needing repair.</p>

                    <p>The GEA approved methods here do not damage the ecobricks during their life cycle.  This means that modules can easily be repaired or they can be disassembled and the ecobricks put to use in a new application.</p>

                    <p>Milstein Modules can be used individually as convenient seats that are sliding and stackable.  Hexagon milstein modules can be  like honeycomb to create horizontal surfaces like tables, beds, benches and more.  Triangle modules can be interlocked with hexagons to make a second level.  For full vertical building see Dieleman module.</p>

                    <p>Ecobrick modular applications are indefinitely scalable.  The more you have the more you can build.  Eventually with hundreds of milstein and dielman communities create Ecobrick Open Spaces— interactive community spaces that can be built, un-built, and built again during conferences and gatherings to serve the needs of the moment.</p>

                    <p>It is important to use modules indoors. Ecobricks should never be exposed to the sun. Ultra violet (UV) rays will gradually fade the ecobricks colors and photo-degrade the plastic bottle’s PET.  After only two or three years, the brittle bottle risks crack and burst, releasing all our hard packed plastic.  Keeping modules entirely indoors and out of the sun is essential to preventing degradation.</p>

                    <p>If there’s anything that the very different earth building traditions around the world have in common it is that they used what was local to them.  Earth building makes use of the earth (sand, clay, rock, pebbles, etc.) that is nearby along with the local organic materials (wood, bamboo, reeds, grasses, etc).  By keeping it local, we reduce the need for long haul transportation.  This ensures a low-energy impact footprint for our building and it encourages the community management of regrowing trees and bamboo to meet local needs.</p>

                    <p>There’s an added bonus.  As we’re using the same resources that our neighbours have access to, they can copy us! As we all work with the same resources, we can learn from the trial and error of our neighbours, and they can learn from us.  Sure and steady, our methods get better and greener.  Since our shared resources come from nearby,  we can also work together in the regrowth and management of resources.</p>
          
                    <p>Today’s commercial construction, in contrast, relies on industrial processes and the transportation of materials from far away.  Often these materials involve much energy in their fabrication and transportation.  Because we don’t get to see where they come from, we are often not aware of the mining, smelting, and energy expenditure behind them.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Essential to Earth and Ecobrick building and the effective sequestration of plastic, is circular design.  This means that whenever we build with ecobrick we ensure that at the end of the construction, the ecobricks can be extricated undamaged and used again.</p>

                <p>This is one of the cheif advantages of buidling with ecobricks and earth.  Unlike cement, when an earthen construction comes to its end, the ecobricks can be extracted undamaed.  During the construction life-span, the earth completely protects the ecobrick from all forms of degradation .  Then at the at its end, cob/adobe/waddle readily crumbles (especially after some soaking) to release the ecobricks un-scarred. Cement, in contrast, crumbles into stiff hard edged rubble that can easily rupture a plastic bottle. </p>

                <p>In addition, not only can the released ecobricks be reused, so too can the crubble earth.  As it has already been mixed to the requisite ratio, only water needs to be added.  After some soaking the earth can be remixed and reapplied in a new construction!

                    <p>The danger of plastic comes from its exposed surface area.  To the extent that plastic’s surface area is exposed to the elements, it will steadily break down over time into smaller and smaller pieces (microplastics) and leach toxins.  By packing and covering ecobricks we keep the plastic safe and secure.</p>

                    <p>Packing plastic into an ecobrick results in the terminal reduction of net surface area. An ecobrick is essentially many many square meters of plastic compressed into a very small space!  Using earth to build with ecobricks is a way to further secure plastic.</p>

                    <p>Earth building involves making a mortar (known as ‘cob’, 'adobe', 'daub', ect.) to completely encase ecobricks. This way not a single square-centimeter of plastic is exposed! Without exposure to sun, friction, or heat the plastic inside the ecobricks can no longer degrade in any way.</p>

                    <p>It is also important to consider the abandonment of projects. Cob, in contrast to cement, can be more readily populated by plants. Even if long-term structures collapse, earth covered ecobricks have no way to degrade and will remain intact indefinitely. The crumbled earth gradually becomes fertile ground for plants, trees, and forest to cover.</p>

                    <p> By building with earth, using circular and spiral principles, we point our ecobricks towards a secured long-term journey through time.</p>

                    <p>We call this trajectory ‘plastic sequestration‘.</p>

                    <p> Earth and Ecobrick constructions embody large amounts of secured plastic.  When building on government or community land, it is key to establish a long term custodial agreement with the owners of the property.  This agreement must include yearly checkups and repairs and also a plan for the destruction of the construction to ensure the indefinite integrity of the ecobricks. This agreement must also account for the eventual removal, ownership and reuse of the embodied ecobricks.</p>

                    <p>It is important not to forget our responsibility when building with plastic.  Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic, and if our constructions lack planning and maintenance, there is the risk of the plastic escaping loose into the biosphere.
