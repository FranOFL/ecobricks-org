				<p>The science is clear:  Plastic loose in the biosphere harms ecosystems, humans and animals.

                        <p>It has never been more important to take care of our plastic and to transition from it.  Plastic sequestration provides a principled alternative to industrial plastic management that can secure plastic indfeinitely.  By following the Earth's ancient example of carbon sequestration with our plastic, we have a proven methodology to follow that can not only secure our plastic but to transition to net-green green enterprise.  </p>

                        In this way keeping plastic out of industrial re-processing is just as important as keeping plastic out of the biosphere.</p>

                    <h5>The goal of plastic sequestration is to follow the Earth's example of carbon sequestration as an ecological service.  This means preventing the degradation of plastic, the emissions and dispersal of industry in a way that is net-green.</h5>

                <div id="preclosed1">

                
                <p><b>1. Preventing Degradation</b><p>

                <p>Plastic degradation occurs physically (such as cracking, embrittlement, and flaking) and chemically (such as leaching).  Emissions and dispersal occur when plastic is industrially processed through recycling, incineration and land-filling.  In order to prevent these outcomes, plastic sequestration diverts plastic from industry and prevents the chemical and physical degration of plastic from the effects of light, heat, acids, friction, microbial action etc.</p>
                <p>Plastic polymer degradation occurs on the exposed surface are of plastic.  Consequently, the rate of degradation is directly proportional to the amount of surface area exposed. Research indicates that that a thin film of HDPE plastic (which has a very large surface area) can degrade 1100 times faster than a bead of plastic of the same weight (very small surface area). For example a thin film of plastic will <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b06635">degrade in 1.8 ± 0.4 years a bead of plastic will endure for 2000 ± 400 years</a>, in the same conditions.</p>
                <p>In this way, plastic sequestration must reduce the specific surface degradation rate (SSDR) of plastic.  By decreasing net surface area, the lifetime of collected plastic can be extended significantly.  By further removing exposure to all forms of chemical and physical degration through appropriate applications, plastic can remain intact almost indefinitely.</p>

                <p><b>2. Preventing Industrial Emissions & Dispersion</b><p>
                <p>Plastic that enters into industry results in a wide range of energy intensive activities from transportation, to smelting, to re-molding.  On average globally, each metric ton of plastic processed by recycling, land-filing and incineration <a href="coefficients.php#co2">generates 689kg, 65Kg and 2967kg of CO2e respectively</a>.
                
                <p>The goal of plastic sequestration is to prevent these emissions.</p>
                    
                <p><b>Preventing Industrial Plastic Dispersion</b></p>
                <p>Plastic that enters into industry is inevitably dispersed around the globe.  Research shows that of all the plastic generated over all-time, the industrial processing of plastic has dispersed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782">91% of all plastic into the biosphere</a>. There it is subject to the chemical and physical degradation pathways mentioned above.</p>
                
                <p>The goal of plastic sequestration is to prevent this dispersion.</p>

                <p><b>Preventing Ecological Disruption</b></p>
                <p>Plastic once loose in the biosphere has been shown to interfere with ecological cycles.  This can impede the ability of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22554-w">phytoplankton to circulate oxygen</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/microplastics-killing-fish-before-they-reach-reproductive-age-study-finds">disrupt fish reproduction</a>, and more.</p>
                <p>The goal of plastic sequestration is to prevents these disruptions.</p>

                <p><b>3. Net-Green Ecological Service</b><p>
                <p><b>Indefinite Reuse in Secure Earthen Applications</b></p>
                <p>Research has shown that covering plastic in earth is an effective method of preventing abiotic plastic degradation (i.e. preventing exposure to sunlight, friction, heat, etc.). Even plastic that is designed to degrade, when it is buried in low-oxygen soil, abiotic and biotic are prevented. Research also shows that submerging plastic in inert soil (minimal bacteria, micro-organisms) can further slow plastic.</p>
                <p>The Earth's billion year process of carbon sequestration has greened the planet.  To ensure that our process of plastic sequestration does the same, we follow the six principles of the Earth's example.  This way we can be sure that plastic sequestration is in fact an ecological contribution.</p>

                <p><b>Accelerating Plastic Transtion</b><p>
                <p>All plastic disposal methods, result in the indirect production of replacement plastic.  Within traditional industrial disposal of plastic for every 1kg of plastic disposed, 0.91kg of plastic can be estimated to replace it.  The awareness raising process of plastic sequestration must be shown to reduce replacement rates to >0.80kg per 1kg.

					<p>Plastic degrades quickly when it is exposed to sun, fire, oxygen and/or friction.  Its degradation is in proportion to its surface area.   As the majority of of modern plastic is in the form of thin films, when it is loose and exposed, it is prone to rapid degradation. Plastic degrades by fragmenting into smaller and smaller particles, known as micro-plastics, green house gases and toxins.</p>

                    <p>By compacting thin, high-surface area plastic, the net exposed area is reduced a thousand-fold.  The GEA has found that a reaching a density of 0.33 g/ml achieves a terminal reduction of net surface area for the majority of modern thin film plastics.  Once compacted and contained plastic is secured from degradation and can remain intact indefinitely.</p>

                    <p>To be considered plastic sequestration, the processing of plastic must achieve the minimum density of 0.33 g/ml and ensure secure, indefinite storage.</p>

                <p>Industrial plastic plastic management methods are by definition linear and circular.  Plastic recycling, incineration and landfilling spirals plastic towards dispersion, the reduction of biodiversity and the depletion of ecosystems.</p>


                <p>In comparison, the Earth has used carbon as a means– in a circular process.  Carbon molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and glycans make up all organisms– and when one organism comes to an end, another begins by building itself with the other’s blocks.  This continues indefinitely, until the carbon is subsumed into long-term sequestration.</p><br>

                <p>Putting creations into greening cycles of reuse is also know as spiral design.  In this way, when our sequestration of plastic leads to short-term creations, they must be by spiral by design– with their next life-cycle built in.</p>
