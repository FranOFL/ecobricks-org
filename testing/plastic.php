In order to use plastic wisely and make safe decisions about its future, knowing its full, science-based history is essential– what we call the ‘long story of plastic’. </p>

According to scientists, an increasing amount of plastic is being manufactured, thrown away and reaching the biosphere, where it harms creatures large and small.</p>

                         <p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">However, its just as important to understand that the story of plastic doesn’t begin in a factory.  Instead, plastic finds its origins millions of years ago on an ancient, barren Earth we would barely recognize.  In fact, the carbon molecules of our modern plastic played a key role in making our common home the thriving and diverse biosphere that we know today.</p>

                        <p data-lang-id="008-page-paragraph">Best of all, we’ve carefully designed the Earthwand’s production, consumption and disposal so that after all the impacts of its life-cycle are added up, it has in the end made the world a greener place.   To see what we mean, see the EarthWand’s Product Impact Assessment (<a href="https://nextcloud.ecobricks.org/index.php/s/gLfD7rTXAWAszie" target="_blank">UK report</a> | <a href="https://nextcloud.ecobricks.org/index.php/s/ScfWXzxcP58YEaN" target="_blank">Indonesian report</a>).  In this way the EarthWand embodies the <a href="/ayyew">ayyew</a>, <a href="https://book.earthen.io" target="_blank">earthen</a> and <a href="principles">regenerative principles</a> which guide the global plastic transition movement.</p>


                        <p data-lang-id="010-page-paragraph">The Earthwand was developed by GEA principal and inventor Russell Maier.  His goal was to create a product that embodied the Earth principles that power the ecobrick movement-- and that energized them.  His was vision was to create not just a great green product, but also a renumeration model that could financially support the local and global plastic transition movement.</p>

                        <p data-lang-id="011-page-paragraph">GEA Trainers are the official sellers of Earthwands.  Proceeds from the sale go to continuing their work-- uch as conducting as many ecobrick workshops as possible in their communities!  Trainers commit to  contributing a minimum of 25% of the retail price back to the GEA to support its global work.  Sale transactions, and the usage of these funds are fully trackable on the <a href="open-books.php">GEA Open Books accounting system</a></p>.
