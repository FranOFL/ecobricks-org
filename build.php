                        <p>That said, building with plastic is a big responsibility.  It is key to build mindfully with ecobricks‚Äì plastic let loose in the environment can can be toxic and our building methods must ensure that it is fully secured.  To make sure that our plastic is safe and secure for the short and the long term the Global Ecobrick Alliance (GEA) has established guidelines and standards for ecobrick building and best-practices.</p>

                        <p>By using  circular design and regenerative design principles we leverage plastic‚Äôs long lasting properties to make ecobricks indefinitely reusable and put our plastic on a safe thousand year journey out of industry and out of the biosphere.   This means, with the help of GEA guidelines, not only can you build cool stuff with ecobricks, but you can be confident your making a greening contribution to the biosphere.</p>

                <p><b>Short-term Applications</b><p>

                <p>Silicone or inner-tube-bands can be used as short-term, non-permanent attachment methods to create ecobrick applications that last for months and up to several years. As short-term applications are not usually covered up, they are typically for indoor use, in order to prevent the UV photodegradation of the bottles.  As short term methods have less barriers to replicability, they assist the spread of the ecobrick social movement by empowering the makers.  The benefit of short-term applications are practicality, utility, replicability, social empowerment and the dissemination of ecobricking</p>

                <br><p><b>Long-term Applications</b><p>
                
                <p>Earth and Ecobrick building techniques are used to create structures that can last years or decades (it is not uncommon for traditional constructions to last centuries!).  Earth mixes (i.e Cob (material), Wattle and daub, adobe) are used to lay ecobricks horizontally and completely cover them for full protection against all forms of degradation.  The main benefit of long-term applications is plastic sequestration‚Äì fully securing plastic from all forms of degradation for the long-haul.</p>

            <p>Before you build with ecobricks, it is essential to store them properly.  Ideally, ecobricks are stored off of the ground (on a floor or raised on wood) and fully protected from the sun and the elements.  Ecobricks are best stacked horizontally with their bottom pointed outwards.  This enables you to organize your ecobricks by colour and brand‚Äì which later facilitates project planning and making.</p>

					<p>The easiest, fastest, and perhaps the most fun ecobrick application, are Milstein Modules (MMs). These are hexagon and triangle shaped configurations of ecobricks that are used for sitting, but can be combined together to form one or two level horizontal surfaces. Applications include tables, beds, stages, etc.  All you need is 12 ecobricks to start!  Generic silicone sealant or motorcycle inner tubes can be used to make MMs . Ecobrick Milstein Modules can then slide into deployment for classes, concerts, meetings and more to make horizontal surfaces.  They can be stacked one on top of the other to add one level of vertical height.  They can be stacked and stored vertically to save space.</p>

                    <h3>Maintenance</h3>

                    <h3>Next Life</h3>
                    <p>  Well used ecobrick Milstein Modules wil last 2-3 years.  After this time, the silicone joints began to weaken and to fail.  Ecobricks also begin to loose their lustre as the colors of the contained plastic begin to fade.  This is a good opportunity to transition them to long term building applications where they are fully protected with earth.

                <p>Industrial plastic plastic management methods are by definition linear and circular.  Plastic recycling, incineration and landfilling spirals plastic towards dispersion.  Industrial methods are powered by fossil fuels that are decompacted and burned, loosening their carbon into the atmosphere.</p>


                <p>In comparison, the Earth has used carbon as a means‚Äì in a circular process.  Carbon molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and glycans make up all organisms‚Äì and when one organism comes to an end, another begins by building itself with the other‚Äôs blocks.  This continues indefinitely, until the carbon is subsumed into long-term sequestration.</p><br>

                <p>Intending net-green outputs that can be reused indefinitely until they are eventually sequestered earthen applications is known as spiral design.</p>

                <br><p><b>Plastic Sequestration Standards</b><p>
                <p>To be considered sequestered, plastic sequestration outputs must be demonstrably reusable.  Their application must prevent abiotic and biotic degradation, reducing  specific surface degradation rate (SSDR) of the plastic to below 0.1 Œºm year‚Äì1.</p>

					<p>In this way, the enterprise of plastic sequestration must account for its various additive (grey) and subtractive (green) ecological impacts and it must show that the net result of the process is the subtraction of plastic and CO2 from the biosphere.  Only when it is net-subtractive can it be considered plastic sequestration.</p>

					<p>Industrial plastic management removes consumer participation and agency in the process.  Through long-distance export, the ecological impact of plastic processing is hidden from consumers. By purporting to have a plastic solution, industry has encouraged the unabated consumption of plastic.  This has led to a steady increase of plastic consumption, production and pollution over the last 50 years.</p>

					<p>Plastic sequestration must be transparent, open and accountable.  Plastic sequestration must return accurate data to those consuming plastic through an accounting of its ecological impacts near and far.</p>

					<p>Only if the process raises individual and collective awareness can it be considered plastic sequestration.</p>
