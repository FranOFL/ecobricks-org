				<p>Combining time-tested local building traditions with ecobricks, we can safely secure our plastic for the long-term in beautiful and functional earthen constructions.</p>

			<div class="page-paragraph">
                <p>Earth and Ecobrick building methods are inspired by the natural building traditions of our ancestors.  Around the world almost every region has its ancient methods of using the local earth to build structures.  Many of these structures have stood for centuries, some for milenia!  By adapting these methods, we can put our ecobricks to good use within them to guide their shape and give them strength.</p>
                
                <p>Not only can we build beautiful, strong and resilient structures, we can secure plastic locally and indefinitely.  This ensures that our plastic, gardens and homes contributes to our children flourishing— and the children of the other species in the ecosystems of which we are part.</p>

                    <p>Earth Building is known by different names around the world– “adobe”, “wattle-and-daub”, “cob”, “organic cement” etc.  These low-energy and low-cost traditions have resulted in incredibly beautiful and varying structures around the world.  Despite their unique shapes and forms they share certain fundamentals in common– such as using local materials, including the community, and enriching the local ecology.  Our ancestors took these principles for granted, but today its more important than ever to learn from the wisdom embedded in their ways.</p>

                    <p>Earth building contrasts starkly with today’s conventional construction methods.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Whereas commercial construction methods rely on high energy, industrial process and are ecologically damaging, earthen building is ecologically enriching.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Whereas commercial construction is powered by petroleum energy and dependent on capital, earthen constructions strives to be free of both.</p></li>  
                        <li><p>Wheras, commercial construction loosens plastic and CO2 into the biosphere, earthen building strives to secure them.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Whereas commercial construction is has a top-down owner/boss/employee structure, earthen building strives to involve everyone in the community.</p></li>

                    <p>If there’s anything that the very different earth building traditions around the world have in common it is that they used what was local to them.  Earth building makes use of the earth (sand, clay, rock, pebbles, etc.) that is nearby along with the local organic materials (wood, bamboo, reeds, grasses, etc).  By keeping it local, we reduce the need for long haul transportation.  This ensures a low-energy impact footprint for our building and it encourages the community management of regrowing trees and bamboo to meet local needs.</p>

                    <p>There’s an added bonus.  As we’re using the same resources that our neighbours have access to, they can copy us! As we all work with the same resources, we can learn from the trial and error of our neighbours, and they can learn from us.  Sure and steady, our methods get better and greener.  Since our shared resources come from nearby,  we can also work together in the regrowth and management of resources.</p>
          
                    <p>Today’s commercial construction, in contrast, relies on industrial processes and the transportation of materials from far away.  Often these materials involve much energy in their fabrication and transportation.  Because we don’t get to see where they come from, we are often not aware of the mining, smelting, and energy expenditure behind them.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In so doing we ensure that the materials we use can be used again and again.  Essential to Earth and Ecobrick building and the effective sequestration of plastic, is circular design.  This is one of the main principles and reasons for the use of earth with ecobricks.</p>

                <p>Unlike cement, when an earthen construction comes to its end, the ecobricks can be extracted and put to use again. Cement is very hard to break up so ecobricks are likely to be damaged in the process, which could also release their contents. Earth completely protects the plastic from all forms of degradation and readily crumbles (especially after some soaking) to release the ecobricks un-scarred. Planning for the next life (or cradle) of a construction is also known as cradle-to-cradle design.</p>

                <p>It is also important to think of abandoned and forgotten constructions.  Unlike cement, cob is fertile, so plants will easily grow on it.  In the case of a forgotten construction, plants will grow, die, and grow again, effectively subsuming the ecobricks over time in earth.</p>

					<p>A common misunderstanding is to confuse building with ecobricks with conventional or commercial building methods: paying builders, using cement and machines, etc.</p>


                    <p>Instead, earth and ecobrick methods are designed from the ground up to be replicable, non-capital, non-petroleum, collaboration powered, using cradle-to-cradle design  </p>

                    <p>Furthermore, earth building techniques are what we call transcaste– meaning that the building process is non hierarchical and readily involves all genders, ages, rich, poor and everyone in between, on a level playing field of participation.</p>

                    <p>The danger of plastic comes from its exposed surface area.  To the extent that plastic’s surface area is exposed to the elements, it will steadily break down over time into smaller and smaller pieces (microplastics) and leach toxins.  By packing and covering ecobricks we keep the plastic safe and secure.</p>

                    <p>Packing plastic into an ecobrick results in the terminal reduction of net surface area. An ecobrick is essentially many many square meters of plastic compressed into a very small space!  Using earth to build with ecobricks is a way to further secure plastic.</p>

                    <p>Earth building involves making a mortar (we call it ‘cob’) to completely encase ecobricks. This way not a single square-centimeter of plastic is exposed! Without exposure to sun, friction, or heat the plastic inside the ecobricks can no longer degrade in any way.</p>

                    <p>It is also important to consider the abandonment of projects. Cob, in contrast to cement, can be more readily populated by plants. Even if long-term structures collapse, earth covered ecobricks have no way to degrade and will remain intact indefinitely. The crumbled earth gradually becomes fertile ground for plants, trees, and forest to cover.</p>

                    <p> By building with earth, using cradle-to-cradle principles, we point our ecobricks towards a long-term journey through time that maximizes its chance of indefinitely securing plastic.</p>

                    <p>We call this trajectory ‘plastic sequestration‘.</p>
