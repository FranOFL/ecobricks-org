			<p>The Ecobrickable Designator is a simple symbol that can be placed on single-use plastic to designate that it should be ecobricked.  Our Kit contains all the graphic files necessary to print stickers on insert into your digital packaging designs. Ecobrickable Designation enables companies to start their transition from linear to circular design, today.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="page-paragraph">
				<p>The majority of todayâ€™s products are manufactured without thought to where they will go once consumed. Many products are even designed to fail within a certain period to promote further consumption. This design ethic (or lack of it) is one of the root causes of plastic pollution.  Learning from the ecologies around us, the first step is to shift from linear consumption design (and dead-end plastic products) to cradle-to-cradle, circular design.  Afterall, plastic isnâ€™t a â€˜badâ€™ material in and of itselfâ€“ its how weâ€™ve been putting it to use that has been causing problems.  Designing a product as Ecobrickable, and clearly designating it as so, can be a giant leap for a company into the brave new world of circular design and regenerative business.  The GEA has developed guidelines and a designator symbol to assist companies in their plastic transition.</i><p> 

				<p>For many companies making the switch to circular design and extended producer responsibility (EPR) appears to require a massive investment in manufacturing, material sourcing as well as implementing new systems to reabsorb their dead products. Furthermore it may seem that the required organic materials are still on the horizon.  The transition can appear daunting!</p>
				
				<p>Making a product ecobrickable is a first step in a businessâ€™s plastic transition.</p>
					
				<p>With a little forethought and advanced planning, a product can be made easily and effectively ecobrickable.  In this way, ecobrickable designs enables companies and designers to make their first step to cradle-to-cradle and ayyew vision.  Designating a product or package as ecobrickable gives it a next life and purpose.  When ecobricked, the plastic is saved from a fate of industrial recycling, incineration, and/or dumping.  The ecobricked plastic is transformed into a reusable building block. Ecobricks and their applications are themselves cradle-to-cradle and follow regenerative principles, enabling an indefinite, localized cycle of reuse of the ecobricked plastic.</p>

                <h3>Ecobrickable Design Guidelines</h3>

<p>The GEA has established simple criteria to meet when designing your product or packaging.  It is obligatory that your product meet these stipulation in order to use Ecobrickable Designator Symbol your product or packaging mustâ€¦</p>

<ul>

    <li>â€¦ not contain substances that will corrode PET plastic over time.</li>
    <li>â€¦ not contain any primary or secondary biodegradable material.</li>
    <li>â€¦ can be easily disassembled, broken or cut into parts that can fit within the 22mm diameter neck of a standard PET bottle.</li>
    <li>...maximizes the ease of disassembly for this purpose.</li>
    <li>â€¦ not have sharp protrusions that could puncture an ecobrick from within while it is being packed down.</li>
    <li>â€¦ not contain reactive chemicals, or if so, these components are clearly marked as un-ecobrickable.</li>
</ul>
