			<p>Ecobricks leverage the resilient properties of plastic to create reusable building blocks.  When we build with ecobricks we plan for the end of the application, for next life of every ecobrick and the enrichment of the ecosystem of which it is part</p>
		</div>

		<div class="page-paragraph">

		<p>It’s a fact of life: everything comes to its end.  Alas, the vast majority of the products we use today go from their birth in a factory, into our hands, to their grave– which is always someplace within the Earth’s biosphere. Pollution is the result.  Designs that fail to anticipate and plan for the end of a product are known as cradle-to-grave.</p>

		<p>With ecobricks, we do things differently!  </p>
	
		<p>
        Guided by the first principle of Earthen ethics, we ensure that not only are ecobricks indefinitely reusable, we also ensure that that each cycle steadily enriches the system of which it is part.  This means we plan for the destruction of our creations and each that both creation and destruction secure more carbon and plastic than they let loose.
        </p>

		<p>Learning from the way ecologies infinitely and perfectly cycle nutrients over and over, we aspire to similar indefinitely cycling.  In other words, we make and we use ecobricks using tehcniques that anticipate their next life cycle.   Instead of the straight line of cradle-to-grave, we draw a circle.  We make sure our ecobricks go from one “cradle” (usage/life/build/application) to the next, to the next with minimal energy and waste. This is known as cyclical design.</p>

		<p>Cyclical design principle underlies every ecobrick method that the GEA endorses.  This way we ensure that every ecobrick remains a reusable building block.  This ethic also helps guide the way that we make ecobricks and the GEA recommended ecobricking techniques.</p>

		<!--<p>This is the reason that when we start an ecobrick we put a colored plastic on the bottom: we’re thinking of the next phase when we’ll build with it.
    This is why we use silicone and not glue when we attach ecobricks to make modules– so that when the module/chair/table comes to its end, we can take it apart to use the ecobricks again.</p>

    <p>This is the reason we build with earth rather than with cement– so that when our bench, garden or home comes to its end, we can extricate the ecobricks undamaged, and put them to use again.</p>

<p>Part of Cyclical Design also includes minimizing the amount of energy and waste produced in the cycling process.  This is where the other ecobrick principles come in!  By ensuring that our methods use local resources, are non-capital, non-petroleum, and community-collaboration powered we minimize the amount of plastic, C02, transportation, and energy required in the cycling.  In this ayyew-way, we’re always striving for tighter and tigher cycling to maximize the regenerative potential of our ecobrick applications.</p>-->

						<p>For the last billion years, Earth has been slow and steady greening the surface of our common home.</p>
						
						<p>The way that Earth has cycled and stored carbon has led to the blossoming of the biosphere– while providing us an example to follow to ensure their own processes are green!  With our plastic– which happens to come from Earth's ancient carbon stores– we can emulate Earth’s example of ensuring that our processes and outputs are not only cyclical, but that lead to ever enriching cycles.</p>

				In the same way that Earth tends its carbon towards cycles of indefinite reuse, so too can we with our plastic.  By packing our plastic into ecobricks and using our ecobricks properly, we can make sure our plastic can be used over and over indefinitely.

						<p>Every day thousands of tons of plastic flow into the biosphere. Meanwhile, the consumption of plastic and its production increase.  In order to be a deep solution to plastic, a regenerative solution must spread at a rate faster than industrial expansion and economic growth rates.  In order to maximize spread, adoption and collective plastic transition we strive to maximize the accessibility of our methods while minimizing the barriers to adoption. In this way, we empower others to make and build with ecobricks so that they can lead by their own example.</p>

					</div>

    			<p><ul>
					<li><b>Localized:</b> By designing with local, organic or upcycled materials (that are ideally freely available) we remove resource barriers to replication.</li>

    			<li><b>Petro Transition:</b> By designing methods that do not require machines, we remove the barrier of technology, specific skills and dependence on petroleum based energy.
    			Transcaste: By designing our methods so that they do not require specialized abilities we remove age, gender and geographical barriers to replication and empowerment.</li>
   				 
				<li><b>Open Source:</b> By making our designs open source according to creative commons specifications and easily accessible on the web, we energize and accelerate replication.
    			Non-Capital:  By designing methods and using materials that do not require capital, we remove the financial barrier to participation and replication.  </li>

				<li><b>Local:</b>  We strive to use locally available resources in our community in the making of ecobricks and when we build with them.  Ecobricking is all about packing our local plastic.  This begins with the very plastic we have personally consumed, then extends to that consumed in our household and community. Ideally we use PET bottles that come from our community and a stick that comes from our area.  This way we transform plastic that would otherwise cause problems in our area with the minimum amount of energy and the maximum amount of social empowerment.</li>

			</ul>

				<p>When it comes to building with ecobricks, the same principal of localized sourcing applies.  We strive to use local materials, processes, skills and culture for our creations.  For example, we have developed the ecobrick tube banding method of bonding ecobricks to make use of the abundance of free and ‘waste’ motorcycle inner-tubes in South East Asia.  In the UK we learn from ancient earth building traditions of wattle and daub to combine ecobricks using local clay, straw and sand.</p>

				<p>By using materials, goods, services and products that come from within our community and ecological region we likewise minimize our dependence on capital and petroleum.</p>

						<p>In our case, it is our common intention of keeping plastic out of the biosphere.  By holding a mission that is to the benefit of individuals, people, communities and the planet, the GEA enables this formidable force to power the realization of its vision.</p>

As a non-capital technology, ecobricking taps a deeper, more potent values such as community cleanliness, the health of children, the richness of the local ecology, to inspire participation, action and long term vision commitment.</p>

			<div class="page-paragraph">    
			
			<p>It can be helpful to better understand what we mean by regenerative by clarifying what it is now.  Ecobricking is often mistaken a ‘sustainable’ technology.  ‘Sustainability’  tends to refer to the virtue of enabling our current human systems and current way of life to continue.  Here, guided by the principles above, ecobricking technology is not this.  Instead, as regenerative technology, we strive to transition from sustaining the current human systems that deplete ecosystems to ways of living that enrich.</p>

			<p>In this way, our principles are not anti-industry, nor anti-petro-capital.  Without them, we would not have come to the principles we now hold.  We acknowledge that yesterday’s use of Earth gifted carbon has been an important formative phase that sets us on our current course-correction.</p>
			
			<div class="row">
                
                    <div class="main2">

			<p>With this we move on from sustaining.  In so far as our modern enterprises work in ways that conflicts with Earth’s example of carbon care, we strive to transition from them.  We also strive to heal and ‘regenerate’ any past damage that we are responsible for.  Finally, in contrast to the sustainability’s focus on minimizing grey impacts, instead we strive in the ayyew spirit of syncing with Earth’s cycles to ever increase our green impacts.</p>
