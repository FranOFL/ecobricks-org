                		<p>Use the Brik Market to arrange exchanges or drop-offs of your ecobricks.</p>
						<p>Ecobricks are awesome for small home projects.  However, sometimes ecobrickers do not have space in their home or they want to assist projects in their community.  On the Brik Market you can post an offer to give your ecobricks away, to trade or barter with them.  All you need is a GoBrik account and a selection of logged and authenticated ecobricks.</p>

                <p>The Brik Market only works with ecobricks that have been logged onto the GoBrik app and that have been sucessfully authenticated to meet GEA standards.  This way, community hubs and project leaders can review the ecobricks that are being offered, and be confident that they are properly made</p>

                <br>
                <!--<p><b>Sell</b></p>
                <p>On the Brik Market you can offer your ecobricks for exchange or delivery.  Ecobricks are priced on the Market per kg of authenticated ecobricked plastic.  Once you have offered the rate by which you wish to sell, the system calculates the batch price of your offer using the logged weight of the ecobricks you have selected to offer for sale.</p>-->

                <br><p><b>Offer for Nothing at All</b><p>
                <p>Alternatively you can offer your ecobricks gratis. Be sure to specify the details for delivery when you make your offer</p>
                
                <br><p><b>Trade & Barter</b></p>
                <p>Offer your ecobricks for a product or service.  You get to specify what you'd like to offer for exchange.</p>

                <br><p><b>Sell using Brikcoins</b></p>
                <p>Soon you'll be able to use your <a href="brikcoins.php">brikcoins</a> on the market to avail of offers, barters and sales.  This is not yet available, but coming soon!</p>

            <p><b>Community Hubs</b></p>
            
            <p>Some ecobrickers offer the service of collecting, storing and distributing ecobricks to community projects.  This involves costs to them that they defer by charging for the service of collecting ecobricks or serving as drop-off centers.</p>

            <p>We refer to these locations as "Ecobrick Community Hubs".  They include cafes, zero-waste shops, restaurant and community centers that are helping accelerate plastic transition in their area.  Paying their requested 'hub fee' is a way to support their valuable service.  Hub fees are calculated as per Kg of AES plastic.  When offering ecobricks, the system will automatically calculate the net weight of your batch and the total fee to be paid to the community hub upon delivery.</p>

				<p>In order to provide a consistent means of pricing ecobricks across their various sizes and shapes, we cost then per kg of <a href="/aes">authenticated ecobricked sequestered plastic</a> (AES plastic).  As only ecobricks that have been logged and authenticated on the GoBrik system are eligible for exchange, the net weight of each ecobrick is already recorded.  This enables the calculation of the total weight of the batch of selected ecobricks being offered for exchanges.</p>  . 

                 <p>Community Hubs specify their fee per Kg of AES plastic.  This fee is arbitrary and set manually by the Hub.  However, pricing is guided by the <a href="https://gobrik.com/#kg/" target="_blank"> global AES price</a> set by the GEA each year.  This fee is multiplied by the net weight of the offered batch up ecobricks. </p>
