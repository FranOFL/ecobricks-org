            <p>Making sure our green impacts outweigh our grey is the only way to do so.</p>

            <p>And plastic offsetting is one place to start!</p>

				<p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">Plastic offsetting, is much like carbon offsetting.  Just as keen green households and companies buy carbon offset credits, so too can they buy plastic offset credits.  Whereas carbon credits help balance off polluting emissions, plastic offsets can be purchased to balance our polluting plastic consumption and production.  These payments then serve as strong financial incentive to stop polluting altogether while empowering those of us working on solutions.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">In the case of carbon offsets, credits correspond to carbon that has been sequestered-- often by tree planting or coral projects that are capturing, concentrating and securing kilograms or tons of carbon dioxide.  In the same way, plastic offsets credits correspond to plastic that has been captured, concentrated and secured.  These <a href="sequestered.php">sequestered plastic</a> credits are also measured in kilograms.</p>

				<p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">
                By far the best way to sequester plastic is through ecobricking.  Ecobricking not only captures, secures and sequesters plastic, it also energizes the reduction in consumption and production of plastic of those involved-- a phenonmenon called <a href="transition.php">plastic transition</a>.</p>

				<p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">However, in order for ecobricked plastic to be considered sequestered, it must be done to specific standards.  Just as not all planted forests represent carbon sequestration (i.e. monoculture forests are known as 'green deserts' for a reason!) not all plastic that is packed is sequestered.  In order to be sequestered, packed plastic must meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_sequestration" target="_blank">the criteria of plastic sequestration</a>. These criteria are based on the principles of Earthen ethics, and are part and parcel of generally accepted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecobricks"> ecobricking standards</a> which the Global Ecobrick Alliance <a href="what.php">maintains and represents</a>.</p>

                        <p data-lang-id="006-third-page-paragraph">As part of our mission to support local and global plastic transition movements, the Global Ecobrick Alliance (GEA) maintains a blockchain based on the validation of ecobricked plastic.  We do so as a not-for-profit, for-Earth enterprise with full financial transparency.</p>
                
                <p>Offsetting and ecobrick validations are both accessed on our <a href="/gobrik">Gobrik app</a>.  There, ecobricker peers validate and authentic whether logged ecobricks meet the criteria of plastic sequestration.  Ecobricks that are authenticated are recorded on the <a href="brikchain">Brikcoin blockchain</a>. Their <a href="/aes">Authenticated Ecobrick Sequestered plastic (AES)</a>then becomes available for purchase as offset credits.</p>
                
                <p>Upon purchase, the GEA issues a serialized certificate for the amount of plastic offsets purchased.  The purchase transaction then  recorded on the brikcoin blockchain and the GEA's open books.  Finally, buyer's account is credited with their AES plastic offset credits and a serialized PDF certificate is issued.

                <p data-lang-id="009-block-1-main-p1">To calculate the price of 1kg of authenticated plastic, the Global Ecobrick Alliance divides its costs of operating and maitaining the blockchain by the amount of plastic that has been authenticated.</p>

                <p>It works like this: In 2022 the Global Ecobrick Alliance incurred 14920 $ USD of expenses in order to authenticate 4,825.42 Kg AES of ecobricked plastic. That works out a cost of 3.09$ USD per Kg in maintaining the block chain and authentication system. This sets our valuation of the price per Kg of AES plastic offsets for the subsequent year.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="024-block-2-main-p1">Our system is carefully designed to ensure that AES offset credits directly corresponds to real-world ecobricked plastic.  In this way everyone benefits:  the planet, the offseters and the ecobrickers doing the hard work.</p>
                
                <p>First (and foremost!), our goal is accelerate the diversion of plastic from pollution into sequestration while energizing our transition from petro-capital and plastic.  This benefits ecobrickers and their community-- and us all!</p>
            
        <p data-lang-id="026-block-2-p2">Secondly, our authentication system provides important practical benefits to ecobrickers and builders.  The process of validating ecobricks encourages high quality ecobricks.  In addition, because serialize ecobricks can be looked up, builders can specify that they only wish to purchase authenticated ecobricks for their projects.  Consequently, the exchange value of serialized authenticated ecobricks is far higher than of un-authenticated ecobricks.  Only authenticated ecobricks can be exchanged on the GoBrik platform.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="038-block-2-p3">Thirdly, only ecobrickers are able to perform the peer review of logged ecobricks and earn Brikcoins-- the core currency of our blockchain.  Brikcoins, an alternative currency based on the ecological value of sequestered plastic, can be used on the GoBrik platform to buy and sell products, register for courses and purcase ecobricks.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="038-block-2-p3">Finally, the cash value of plastic offset credits goes direct to the Global Ecobrick Alliance to cover its expenses of maintining Ecobricks.org, the GoBrik app and Brikcoin blockchain for the global movement.  Through our open books system, and for-Earth mandate, our team strives to continuously maximize the value offered to ecobrickers and the ecosystems we serve.</p>
