            <p data-lang-id="004-lead-page-paragraph">We live in a world where its almost impossible to avoid plastic.  Nonetheless, the plastic that we consume and produce will have an ecological impact for a long time to come.  By taking responsibility for our plastic today, we can lead by example to ensure our net impact on the planet is green.</p>
<!--

				<p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">Offsetting is way to balance off our grey ecological impacts, with green.  Plastic offsetting, is much like carbon offsetting.  In the same way that a household or a company buy carbon offset credits to balance off their emissions, plastic offsets can be purchase to balance our plastic consumption and production.</p>  
                    
                <p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">In the case of carbon offsets, credits correspond to carbon that has been sequestered-- often by tree planting or coral projects that are capturing, concentrating and securing kilograms or tons of carbon dioxide.  In the same way, plastic offsets credits correspond to plastic that has been captured, concentrated and secured.  These <a href="sequestered.php">sequestered plastic</a> credits are also measured in kilograms.</p>

				<p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">
                By far the best way to sequester plastic is through ecobricking.  Ecobricking not only captures, secures and sequesters plastic, it also energizes the reduction in consumption and production of plastic of those involved-- a phenonmenon called <a href="transition.php">plastic transition</a>.</p>

				<p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">However, in order for ecobricked plastic to be considered sequestered, it must be done to specific standards.  Just as not all planted forests represent carbon sequestration (i.e. monoculture forests are known as green deserts for a reason!) not all plastic that is packed is sequestered.  In order to be sequestered, packed plastic must meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_sequestration" target="_blank">the criteria of plastic sequestration</a>. These criteria are based on the principles of Earthen ethics, and are part and parcel of generally accepted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecobricks"> ecobricking standards</a> which the Global Ecobrick Alliance <a href="what.php">maintains and represents</a>.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="006-third-page-paragraph">As part of our mission to support local and global plastic transition movements, the Global Ecobrick Alliance maintains a blockchain based on the validation of ecobricked plastic.  This system, which is accessed on our <a href="/gobrik">Gobrik app</a>, enables peers to validate and authentic whether ecobricks meet the criteria of plastic sequestration.  Ecobricks that are authenticated are recorded on the <a href="brikchain">Brikcoin blockchain</a>. Their <a href="/aes">Authenticated Ecobrick Sequestered plastic (AES)</a>then becomes available for purchase as offset credits.</p>
                
                <p>Upon purchase, the GEA issues a serialized certificate for  amount of plastic offset.  This purchase is also recorded on the brikcoin blockchain and the user's account is credited with their AES plastic offset credits.
