				<p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">Plastic offsetting is way to balance off the grey impact of the plastic you or your company consume and produce with green impacts.  Its a concept that is very similar to that of carbon offseting-- when a household or a company buy 'carbon offset credits' to balance off the carbon that they have emitted.  Often the carbon offsets correspond to biodiverse forests that are being renegerated or coral reefs that are being restored have captured, concentrated and secured.  This carbon is considered sequestered and is calculated by its weight.</p>  
                    
                <p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">In the same way, plastic offsets credits correspond to plastic that has been captured, concentrated and secured.  This <a href="sequestered.php">sequestered plastic</a> is likewise measured by its weight-- in tons and in kilograms.</p>

				<p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">
                By far the best way to sequester plastic is through ecobricking.  Ecobricking not only captures, secures and sequesters plastic, it also energizes the reduction in consumption and production of plastic of those involved-- a phenonmenon called <a href="transition.php">plastic transition</a>.</p>

				<p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">However, in order for ecobricked plastic to be considered sequestered, it must be done to specific standards.  Just as not all planted forests are true carbon sequestration (i.e. monoculture forests known as green deserts!) not all packed plastic is sequestered.  In order to be sequestered, packed plastic must meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_sequestration" target="_blank">the criteria of plastic sequestration</a>. These Earthen criteria are part and parcel of generally accepted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecobricks"> ecobricking standards</a> which the Global Ecobrick Alliance <a href="what.php">maintains</a>.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="006-third-page-paragraph">As a not-for-profit, for-Earth enterprise, the Global Ecobrick Alliance also maintains a peer-powered blockchain that validates whether ecobricked plastic meets ecobricking standards and the criteria of plastic sequestration.  Ecobricks that are authenticated as such are recorded on the <a href="brikchain">Brikcoin blockchain</a> and their plastic becomes accredited.</p>
                
                <p>We refer to this as <a href="/aes">Authenticated Ecobrick Sequestered plastic (AES)</a>.  Through our <a href="/gobrik">Gobrik app</a>, these credits are available for personal and company purchase.  Upon purchase, the GEA issues you a serialize certificate for your purchase of Authenticated Ecobrick Sequestered Plastic (AES Plastic). Your purchase is logged on the brikcoin blockchain and your account credited with AES plastic offset credits.
