Its simple, yet super practical, ergonomic, sturdy and strong.  Best of all, its made without plastic-- fully hand crafted from bamboo, rattan and coconut fiber.</p>

                         <p>Developed over three years of ecobricking and prototyping by one of the co-founders of the Global Ecobrick Alliance, the Earthwand it is designed to not only pack plastic, but to support the local and global ecobrick movement financially. EarthWands are produced by GEA Trainer and sold by GEA Trainers as a way to fund their ecological enterprises– such as conducting as many ecobrick workshops as possible in their communities!  Trainers also contribute a minimum of 25% of the retail price back to the GEA to support its global work.  Sale transactions, and the usage of these funds are fully trackable on the GEA Open Books accounting system.</p>

                        <p>Best of all, we’ve carefully designed the Earthwand’s production, consumption and disposal so that after all the impacts of its life-cycle are added up, it has in the end made the world a greener place.   To see what we mean, see the EarthWand’s Product Impact report.  In this way the EarthWand is a symbol of the ayyew and regenerative principles which inspire the global plastic transition movement.</p>

                        <h4>More than a product</h4>

                        <p>The core design of the EarthWand were developed by GEA principal and inventor Russell Maier as an embodiment of the regenerative principles behind the ecobrick movement.  The EarthWand thus is much more than a simple product…</p>

                        <p>It is a way for ecobrickers to support their Trainer, the GEA, regenerative makers and the Ecobricking movement.</p>
