    '004-lead-page-paragraph': 'Ecobricks can be made by the young, the old and everyone in between ‚Äî no machines, special skills or experts required!  However, there are important guidelines to follow to ensure the quality and usability of your ecobricks.',
    '005-first-page-paragraph': 'Be sure to start ecobricking right‚Äî this is a long-term life habit that you, your household and community are beginning.  Likewise, your ecobricks will set the example for everyone around you.  Sub-standard ecobricks will compromise the quality of furniture modules, constructions and the social spread of ecobricks while, well-done ecobricks can be put to good, safe use and will secure plastic for centuries.  We‚Äôve put this 10 step guide together to help you on your journey of making great ecobricks.',
    '006-block-1-opener-header': '1. Save, Segregate, Clean & Dry Plastics',
    '007-block-1-opener-subheader': 'Ecobricks are made with clean and dry plastic.  Start by segregating your plastic from all other materials.',
    '008-block-1-opener-main-image-alt': '<img src="../pngs/01-Save-Segregate-Prep-your-Plastics-800px.png" width="640" loading="lazy" class="full-width-image" alt="Save, segragate, clean, dry plastics">',
    '009-block-1-opener-subheader': 'Some ecobrickers bring a bottle with them everywhere they go.  Others save up their ecobrickable plastic in a bin til they have time to get to it.',
    '010-block-1-paragraph': 'If there is any food, oil or dirt on your plastic, be sure to wash it off.  Dirty plastic inside an ecobrick will lead to microbiological growth and methane forming inside your ecobrick (for a solution for dirty plastic see the Ocean Ecobrick).  Since ecobricks are often used to make home furniture you also want to avoid unsightly ecobricks, bloated bottles and in rare cases, caps popping off.',
    '011-block-1-opener-subheader': 'Its likewise important that the plastic is dry!  Wet and moist plastic will also encourage mircobial growth.  Ecobrikers around the world use different methods for drying their washed plastic‚Äì from laundry machines to cloths lines.',
    '012-block-1-advanced': 'Advanced',
    '013-block-1-advanced-paragraph': 'üí° Many ecobrickers track their household‚Äôs plastic consumption on a monthly basis in order to determine their Plastic Transition Ratio (PTR).  Over the course of the calendar month they save, clean and dry their consumed plastic and put it into a dedicated bin.  At the end of the month, they weigh this plastic and record the amount (our GoBrik app can help you do this!).',
    '014-block-1-advanced-image-alt': '<img src="../pngs/weighed-plastic-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" loading="lazy" alt="weighed plastic">',
    '015-block-1-advanced-paragraph': 'They then transfer this plastic into their ‚ÄúTo Ecobrick‚Äù bin, which anyone in the home can use to directly ecobrick.  Month by month ecobrickers track their plastic, and compare it to their month ecobrick.  This enables them to determine their PTR and their progress reaching zero waste and going beyond!',
    '016-block-2-opener-header': '2. Choose your bottle',
'017-block-2-opener-subheader': 'Before you start ecobricking, choose one specific bottle and stick with it.',
'018-block-2-main-image-alt': '<img src="../svgs/02-Choose-your-Bottle-1.svg" width="640" alt="Choose the ideal bottle type" loading="lazy" class="full-width-image">',
'019-block-2-paragraph-1': 'When it comes time to building, having perfectly identical ecobrick sizes is important for making solid and steady modules. It also helps having at least the same general size of bottle when it comes to building with earth and ecobricks. Talk with ecobrickers in your community and make the choice together of what bottle to use.',
'020-block-2-paragraph-2': 'When selecting the bottle that you will use, consider three factors: the bottle‚Äôs availability, the volume, and the project you will use the ecobrick for.',
'021-block-2-list-availability': '<strong>Availability</strong>',
'022-block-2-list-availability-detail': 'The last thing you want to have to do is buy drinks to have a bottle for your ecobricking! Soon many people will be ecobricking in your community and it is ideal to have everyone using the same brand and bottle. Be sure to choose a bottle that everyone can easily come by.',
'023-block-2-list-volume': '<strong>Bottle Volume</strong>',
'024-block-2-list-volume-detail': 'Choose the bottle volume you want to go with. GEA Trainers teach ecobricking with bottles under 600ml. Large 1500ml bottles will take a lot of plastic, but also take a long time to make! Small volume bottles allow first-time ecobrickers to finish their first ecobrick and quickly learn from their mistakes. Large bottles are best for advanced ecobrickers.',
'025-block-2-list-project': '<strong>Your Project</strong>',
'026-block-2-list-project-detail': 'For building modules with Ecobricks, you need bottles that are exactly the same size and shape. For outdoor building projects, exact sameness is not so important, so long as the volume is consistent (i.e. all 600ml bottles). Depending on the size of construction, you will need different size bottles. For example, small bottles make good walls, and large bottles make good benches.',
'027-block-2-advanced-title': 'Advanced',
'028-block-2-advanced-paragraph': 'üí° If you‚Äôre thinking of making <a href="../dms">Dieleman Lego Modules</a> with your ecobricks, you must also consider the top tapper of your bottle. Dieleman modules work best when the distance between the top of the bottle and the start of the tapper is small. This allows more surface area for the inverted peg of the Dieleman module to be attached.',


'029-block-3-opener-header': '3. Get your stick ready',
'030-block-3-opener-subheader': 'Ecobrickers like to call their packing stick, their magic wand. It makes the plastic disappear!',
'031-block-3-main-image-alt': 'Pack your eco-brick with recycle plastics using a stick',
'032-block-3-paragraph-1': 'Having the right stick will make a big difference to your ecobricking.',
'033-block-3-paragraph-2': 'Bamboo and wood make the best sticks. The size of the stick depends on the type of bottle you go with. You want a stick with a diameter roughly one third the width of a standard bottle opening‚Äì so about 6mm. You want your stick to be about twice the height of your bottle, with a slightly rounded tip. Avoid sharp cornered sticks as they can rupture your bottle‚Äì and yes, this means you have to start your ecobrick all over again!',
'034-block-3-paragraph-3': 'Once you\'ve got a stick with a good size and shape, you‚Äôre set! You can then give it to others to copy and replicate. That‚Äôs how our GEA Trainers do their workshops- more magic! One stick turns into many!',
'035-block-3-advanced-title': 'Advanced',
'036-block-3-advanced-paragraph': 'üí° The GEA has developed the optimal ecobricking tool‚Äì we call it the EarthWand. Earthwands can usually be purchased from GEA Trainers after a workshop, or you can order them from the GoBrik Shop. EarthWands are a regenerative product whose sale goes to support the local and global ecobrick movement.',
