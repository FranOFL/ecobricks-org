Every ecobrick that is authenticated on the <a href=\"/gobrik\">GoBrik platform</a> is permanently recorded on the <a href=\"brikcoins.php\">Brikcoin Manual Blockchain</a>. With each authentication, the corresponding value of sequestered plastic (<a href=\"/aes\">AES plastic</a>) is issued in brikcoins</a>. Each issuance is made through a block of transactions that are recorded sequentially. This chain of blocks, transaction and ecobricks is fully searchable here.",
