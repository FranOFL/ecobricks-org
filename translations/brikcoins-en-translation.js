        "002-splash-subtitle": "A manual proof-of-value blockchain based on the sequestration of plastic from the biosphere.",
        "004-lead-paragraph": "Based on real world ecological value, the Brikcoin manual-blockchain energizes our petro-capital transition to a regenerative world.",
        "005-page-paragraph1": "Brikcoins (BRK / ß) are generated by human work and based on ecological value.",
        "006-page-paragraph2": "More than just numbers in a ledger, every brikcoin correlates directly with plastic that has been secured from polluting the biosphere— and permanently removed from high-emissions industries. In the same way that ancient gold and silver coins have a value in and of themselves, Brikcoins are based on the ecological value that they represent.",
        "007-page-paragraph3": "We call this a <i>proof-of-value, manual blockchain.</i>",
  
        "008-header-ecological-value": "Ecological Value",
        "009-subheader-carbon-concentration": "In following the Earth's example of carbon concentration we can generate authentic ecological and utility value.",
        "010-main2-paragraph": "Two billion years ago, Earth's atmosphere was full of carbon dioxide. The planet's climate was unstable and its surface barren. However, steadily the atmosphere's CO2 was cycled into carbon-based life, which, generation after fallen generation, was buried and secured into the ground. As more and more <a href=\"/plastic\">carbon ended up sequestered</a>, there was less and less CO2 in the atmosphere. Steadily the climate stabilized and Earth's biosphere blossomed.",
        "011-main3-paragraph": "Today, our petroleum based plastic comes directly from these ancient underground carbon stores. As a form of carbon, what we do with our plastic can be of ecological benefit— <i>or not</i>.",
        "012-paragraph-dumping-effects": "When plastic is dumped, it degrades into dangerous micro-plastics. When plastic is incinerated it returns to the atmosphere as CO2. And when plastic that is processed by industry it causes factories to spin and churn, resulting in more emissions and more plastic products.",
        "013-paragraph-securing-carbon": "However, by following Earth's example of securing, concentrating and sequestering our carbon we can keep our plastic out of the biosphere and out of industry. This work has important ecological value insofar as it avoids pollution, disperses benefit, and supports biodiversity.",
        "014-paragraph-plastic-sequestration": "This process of <a href=\"sequest\">plastic sequestration</a> is defined as a manual, net-zero, non-industrial process (see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_sequestration\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia page</a>). In order to be sequestered, the resulting secured-plastic must meet the criteria of plastic sequestration to ensure that it is in fact green.",
        "015-paragraph-ecobricking": "One of the most universal and accessible means of plastic sequestration is <a href=\"what.php\">ecobricking</a>.",
        "016-paragraph-ecobricked-plastic-value": "Ecobricked plastic, <i>if it has been authenticated to have met the criteria of plastic sequestration</i>, embodies an ecological and utility value. This value can be quantified by the weight of the plastic sequestered within it.",
        "017-paragraph-brikcoins-aes": "Brikcoins are based on the ecological value of <a href=\"/aes\">Authenticated Ecobrick Sequestered plastic (AES plastic)</a>.",
