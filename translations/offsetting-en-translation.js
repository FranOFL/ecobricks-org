        "002-splash-subtitle": "By taking responsibility for our personal plastic we can energize local and global plastic transition.",
        "003-splash-image-alt": '<img src="../icons/eco-accounting-icon-from-ecobricks-org-white.svg" style="width: 86%" alt="Ecological impact accounting to ensure we are green.">',
        "004-lead-page-paragraph": "We live in an age where its almost impossible to avoid plastic.  Nonetheless, the plastic that we use today will have an ecological impact for ages to come.  By taking responsibility for our plastic today, we can ensure that tomorrow, our overall impact is green.",
        "005-first-page-paragraph": "And plastic offsetting is a place to start!",
        "006-second-page-paragraph": "Offsetting is all about making sure our green impacts outweigh our grey. Just as keen green households and companies buy carbon offset credits, so too can they buy plastic offset credits.  Whereas carbon credits help balance off our emissions, plastic offsets can be purchased to balance our plastic consumption and production.  Paying for offset credits serves as strong financial incentive for buyers to reduce and eliminate their plastic use altogether.</p>",
        "007-third-page-paragraph": "Meanwhile, payments go direct to energizing those working hard to sequester plastic and transition from it.",

        "008-block-5-opener-header": "Like Carbon Offsetting— but for plastic!",
        "009-block-5-opener-subheader": "If curbing CO2 emissions are an important part of being green― so too is curbing our plastic polluting.",
        "010-block-5-paragraph": "In carbon offsetting, \"credits\" correspond to carbon that has been <i>sequestered</i>― for example by tree planting or coral restoration projects.  Such projects energize systems that capturing, concentrate and secure kilograms of carbon dioxide.",
        "011-block-5-paragraph": "In the same way, plastic offsets credits correspond to plastic that has been captured, concentrated and secured.  These <a href=\"sequestered.php\">sequestered plastic</a> credits are also measured in kilograms (significantly, plastic itself is on average ).",
        "012-block-5-paragraph": "Ecobricking is ideal for sequestering plastic.  Ecobricks not only captures, secures and sequesters plastic, it also energizes the reduction in consumption and production of plastic of those involved― a phenonmenon called <a href=\"transition.php\">plastic transition</a>.",
        "013-block-5-paragraph": "<strong><b>Not all that is green is green</b></strong>",
        "014-block-5-paragraph": "In order for ecobricked plastic to be considered sequestered, it must be done to specific standards― and verified as such!",
        "015-block-5-paragraph": "Just as not all planted forests represent ecological enrichment (i.e. monoculture 'green-desert' forests) not all plastic that is packed is of ecological value.  In order to be considered effectively sequestered, packed plastic must meet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_sequestration\" target=\"_blank\">the criteria of plastic sequestration</a>. These criteria are based on the principles of Earthen ethics, and are part and parcel of generally accepted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecobricks\"> ecobricking standards</a> which the Global Ecobrick Alliance <a href=\"what.php\">maintains and represents</a>.",
