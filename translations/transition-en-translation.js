    "005-second-page-paragraph": "It can be overwhelming to hear about all the ecological crises of our day.  Climate change, deforestation, ocean acidification— they make the problem of plastic pollution seem minor issue in comparison! However, like all our ecological issues, plastic pollution is a symptom of our petro-capital economy– the way our society is powered by fossil fuels.",
